<p>This page collects implementations of a thread-based discussion application all interacting with the same API.  The intent is to provide side-by-side comparisons for tasks every ES2015 client application will necessarily complete.  </p>
<p>The main application shows a list of threads similar to a well known Internet discussion forum.  The user can create a new thread, display a thread&#39;s comments, and respond to a specific comment.  <a href="http://backbone.threaditjs.com">This is a baseline implementation</a></p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Much respect is intended for TodoMVC.  But even TodoMVC talks about MV* instead of MVC, and a theoretical design pattern label isn&#39;t a good descriptor for the problems we&#39;re trying to solve with modern web applications.  </p>
<p>Implementing ThreaditJS with a framework involves: </p>
<ul>
<li>Interacting with a backend that maintains its own state</li>
<li>More comprehensive use of routing</li>
<li>A more revealing use case for DOM manipulation</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to have an application with roughly similar simplicity while providing an example that lets you see how a framework will help you do the things you&#39;ll actually be doing.  </p>
<p>(And yes, I know that some TodoMVC implementations toy with having a router or a more complex backend, but it isn&#39;t a basic component of the project.)  </p>
<h2 id="the-threaditjs-api">The ThreaditJS API</h2>
<p>All implementations will use the same API, located at api.threaditjs.com.  Arguably someone could even come up with a native mobile consumer implementation.  </p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Currently, I only have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://backbone.threaditjs.com">Backbone</a></li>
</ul>
